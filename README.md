A web portal for personalizable things related to Battlefield2, for example your favorite BF2 servers.

Currently under early development. 

Goal is to kickstart my frontend know-how and learn more about Blazor WASM while also producing something handy for the BF2 family.

Made using C# and ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly

Special thanks to @cetteup for providing the bflist.io API
