A web portal with customizable gadgets related to the game Battlefield 2, e.g. your favorite BF2 servers, live streams and resources.

Currently under early development.

# Goals

Kick-starting my frontend know-how and learning more about [Blazor WASM](https://blazor.net/).

Building something useful for the BF2 community.

Having a personal dashboard to see what's going on, before playing a round of BF2. 

# About

Made using C# and [ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly](https://blazor.net/).

Special thanks to [@cetteup](https://github.com/cetteup) for providing the [bflist.io](https://bflist.io/api-endpoints/battlefield-2/) API and moral support.
